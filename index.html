You can go to any authorized seller and pick up a sim card after filling out a single page form. After an hour, your new phone number will be registered with Nepal Telecom and you can make and receive calls as you please. A pretty standard process however my experience inside this one phone number store in Dillibazar was anything but.</p><p>Nepal has had a long history of internet cafes from the early days when the internet wasn&rsquo;t a household commodity. Although the rise in cell phones across the country have drastically reduced foot traffic for people trying to get online, a lot of these places have expanded to include office services––think the ups store.</p><p>Small business ownership is the backbone of Nepali economy. However a lot individual proprietors have this indescribable self assured attitude that I&rsquo;ve never encountered anywhere else. My guy at the internet cafe helping me get a new phone number was the stuff of legends.</p><p>He was already dealing with at least two customers when I entered to get a data plan. He was helping a gentleman fill out some official paperwork when without missing a beat he started telling me about the available plans. Oh he was also engaged in a what looked like a one sided facetime while this was going on. Not a single customer looked unhappy and they seem totally at east with the man&rsquo;s interleaved attention. At one point, I was running into an issue verifying the data connection on phone and he simply took my phone, dialed the support line, and spoke to them to verify my connection, handed me back the phone, and proceeded to help someone else.</p><p>Honestly, I was just whiplashed from this man&rsquo;s efficiency to take in all that was going on. My cousin told me later on that he was also munching on corn the whole time we were there. Literally did not notice. His process management was on par with an advanced os level task scheduler. I will need to come back for the implementation details.</p></section><h3 class=text-left>- tagus</h3><div class=mt-3xl><hr class=line><div class="color-gray-2 spacing-x-s"><a class=font-2s href=/entries>entries</a>
