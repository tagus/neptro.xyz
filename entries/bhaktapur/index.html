Known for its well preserved Malla dynasty architecture and immaculate temples. It is a heavily trafficked location with a steady flow of both locals and tourists. Determining which group I fall under is an existential dread for another day.</p><p>A lot of travel guides online describe Bhaktapur as a city &ldquo;frozen in time&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not a big fan of this descriptor because I feel like it discounts everyday people that are carrying on their normal lives within the city. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the city itself is extremely well preserved––given that it&rsquo;s a UNESCO world heritage site.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll notice a lot of red bricked pagodas with some of the most detailed wood working out there along with charming stone sculptures. However, you&rsquo;ll also see students walking to school, peddlers selling various goods in the interconnecting alleyways, and local craftsmen doing their own thing.</p><figure class=photo-container><span class="tape tape-tm"></span><img class=photo src=https://storage.googleapis.com/neptro-entries/bhaktapur/wood-working.jpeg></figure><p>I was in Bhaktapur in 2015, right after the earthquake, which very nearly destroyed all of the city. The temples had literally come undone and some were being precariously held in place by wooden support beams. It was heartbreaking to see empty voids where larger than life temples had once stood.</p><p>Unlike before, this time around I went to Bhaktapur with my childhood friend with the intention of spending the whole day taking in the city. A lot of the temples had been repaired as before while some were still stuck in the bureaucratic mire of restoration. We spent hours sitting on the patio surrounding the inner square just people watching. We were there for so long that the same beggars came repeatedly asking for alms as they made their rounds.</p><figure class=photo-container><span class="tape tape-tm"></span><img class=photo src=https://storage.googleapis.com/neptro-entries/bhaktapur/alley.jpeg></figure><p>There was a newlywed couple, with the bride (behuli) wearing a deep red, gold brocaded, velvet dress and the groom (behula) wearing a boring old tux. They were taking their bridal photos with Bhaktapur as their backdrop. The team of photographers were posing them from one location making sure that the lighting was just right. I bet you the final photos were hyper saturated with the couple staring deeply into each other&rsquo;s eyes. It was entertaining watching them running around and trying out different &ldquo;couple&rdquo; type poses but I&rsquo;m sure they were exhausted by the end of it. You only live once right?</p><p>My friend and I walked the whole square and I didn&rsquo;t even get asked for an entry fee this time around. We were on the hunt for a particular &ldquo;bara wo&rdquo; restaurant. After asking for multiple directions and being lead around in circles, we found it unexpectedly. It was a hole in the wall place (Bara-Wo Newari Food) being run by the same grandma for almost four decades. It is one of the best bara you can find across KTM––its humble setting only enhancing the flavor.</p><p>A bara is a traditional newari stable; it is essentially a pancake made out of black lentil flour, served with a sunny side up egg and ground buffalo. It is optionally served with a bodi (black eyed beans) and tama (bamboo shoots) stew.</p><p>As the day ramped down, my friend and I climbed to the top floor of one of the pagodas in the square. We sat there listening to music as people came and went. Joy Crookes and Freddie Mercury really supplemented the 12th century architecture.</p><figure class=photo-container><span class="tape tape-tm"></span><img class=photo src=https://storage.googleapis.com/neptro-entries/bhaktapur/temple.jpeg></figure><p>We definitely need to go back.</p></section><h3 class=text-left>- tagus</h3><div class=mt-3xl><hr class=line><div class="color-gray-2 spacing-x-s"><a class=font-2s href=/entries>entries</a>
