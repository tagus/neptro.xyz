As someone that drives like an old person in the US by leaving tons of open space between cars, being on the road in KTM is a lesson in patience and focus.</p><p>Riding a bike is vastly different than a car. It&rsquo;s a much more physical experience where you directly weather the wind and feel every bump on the road, which there is no lack of in KTM. So naturally I wanted to ride a bike myself. My cousin was my instructor and <em>lucky</em> for me he drives a Honda CRF, which is a heavy duty motocross dirt bike designed for serious off-roading.</p><p>We went to an open valley in Chobhar, right at the outskirts of KTM. It has an open ground overlooking the valley and many people come here to practice driving. Having only driven automatic cars up to this point, I was an absolute beginner.</p><figure class=photo-container><span class="tape tape-tm"></span><img class=photo src=https://storage.googleapis.com/neptro-entries/riding-a-bike/chobar.jpeg></figure><p>The bike has four main components: the throttle for acceleration, the front break lever, the rear brake foot pedal, the gear change pedal, and finally the clutch that is used during gear changes. Manual transmissions require a lot more attention from drivers. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around the clutch/throttle relationship.</p><p>You start driving on the first gear, which inputs a lot of power but provides bad mileage. You need to slowly let go of the clutch lever while accelerating. If you let go of the clutch too quickly or accelerate too fast, the bike will suddenly stop and shut off. As you slowly pick up speed, you can progressively change to the higher gears. However the bike will sputter if you change gears without picking up enough speed. Oh and make sure you use the clutch when changing gears otherwise you can potentially damage the engine?</p><p>I managed to ride around in circles in Chobar and change gears fittingly (max up to three tho). However my fleeting confidence went caput when I drove in the KTM streets for the first time. Without any formal lanes, the amount of activity and vehicles to keep track of was overwhelming. People were idle in the inner roads, dogs were taking naps on the sides, cabs were trying to squeeze into the narrow alleys, and other bikes were trying to pass me. I slowly managed to ride around my cousin&rsquo;s neighborhood with him behind me giving me careful directions. I was terrified the whole time and promptly gave up the wheel; but boy am I excited to try again next week.</p></section><h3 class=text-left>- tagus</h3><div class=mt-3xl><hr class=line><div class="color-gray-2 spacing-x-s"><a class=font-2s href=/entries>entries</a>
