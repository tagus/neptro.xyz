The entire journey is just 43.1 km or 26 miles for folks at home. However, the trip takes well over two hours because the road meanders beside sheer cliffs the whole time and is heavily trafficked leading to minor congestions and extreme wear. For reference, traveling 48 km (30 miles) back in VA took me roughly 45 minutes.</p><p>This road sees a lot of vehicles and is ravaged by constant wear. Furthermore, the adjacent cliffs are not reinforced thus heavy rain leads to a lot of erosion and landslides. There are potholes so large that entire chunks of the road are missing. There is sporadic construction along the road but most of it seems reactive to curb ongoing destruction caused by recent weather.</p><figure class=photo-container><span class="tape tape-tm"></span><img class=photo src=https://storage.googleapis.com/neptro-entries/the-weary-road/valleys.jpeg></figure><p>Driving down this weary road takes some serious skill as you not only have to navigate through incoming traffic from sharp turns but you have to constantly drive on uneven roads that probably does wonders for your vehicle&rsquo;s suspension. I noticed that most cars judiciously used their horns to signal potential traffic across bends; there were blind spot mirrors but damage from the constantly blowing dust rendered them useless.</p><p>You can also see houses bordering both sides of the road at various checkpoints. Some are tin hatched one story houses however there are more recent developments as well. You have to admire the foundation being able to withstand uneven terrain and risks of landslide. On sunny days, there is loose dust everywhere such that you&rsquo;ll be coated in a ghostly layer of white if you&rsquo;re traveling by bike. On rainy days, there are puddles and mud that increase the risk of slipping.</p><figure class=photo-container><span class="tape tape-tm"></span><img class=photo src=https://storage.googleapis.com/neptro-entries/the-weary-road/houses.jpeg></figure><p>On early mornings, you can see an eerie fog that limits visibility to the nearest car. The fog lifts pretty quickly and the surrounding valleys really give the smoky mountains a run for their money.</p><p>Before we reached Tansen, we stopped at Jodhdhara to eat batuks. These are mini donut shaped fried fitters made from black lentils; the supplementary chutney was a bit spicy but was just as tasty as I remembered. Coupled with some excellent chiya and unbeatable views, I was set.</p></section><h3 class=text-left>- tagus</h3><div class=mt-3xl><hr class=line><div class="color-gray-2 spacing-x-s"><a class=font-2s href=/entries>entries</a>
