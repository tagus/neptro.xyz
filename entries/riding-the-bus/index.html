You don&rsquo;t know when a bus is coming around the corner, you have no idea where the bus stops are, there are no maximum occupancy rules, and getting off is an adventure in its own right.</p><p>Public buses have a notorious reputation in Nepal for being unruly and uncomfortable. Everyone was telling me to stay away so naturally I had to try for myself. I embarked on a bus to go see <a href=/entries/bhaktapur>Bhaktapur</a> on the weekend. I managed to get a seat and although a bit packed, it was relatively comfortable. Thinking that it wasn&rsquo;t too bad, I tried my luck the following week to use the bus to get to work.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no direct route from Gyaneshwor to Pulchowk so I knew that I would have to find a transfer. There are named buses in KTM that follow a certain route and most of them eventually end up in Sundhara. I had to take the &ldquo;Samyukta Yatayat&rdquo; to another transfer point. Fortunately in KTM, buses are fairly consistent however there is no set schedule or interval for when buses arrive. Furthermore, bus stops are basically anywhere you can make yourself visible on the bus route.</p><p>On an early spring morning, I stood outside my neighborhood. My sense of direction was so bad that I was actually standing on the opposite side from where I needed to be. Thankfully a kind lady working at a nearby store pointed me in the right direction. I saw the bus leave as I was crossing the road. Trying my luck again, I waited lightly sweating through my sweater. I saw another &ldquo;Samyukta&rdquo; coming my way so I quickly raised my hand to flag it down.</p><figure class=photo-container><span class="tape tape-tm"></span><img class=photo src=https://storage.googleapis.com/neptro-entries/riding-the-bus/conductor.jpeg></figure><p>All buses in Nepal have a conductor or &ldquo;Khalasi&rdquo;. They inform the driver when to stop (and start) the bus, collect passenger fares, and generally coordinate passengers on the bus. Although named buses follow the same route, they are individually owned and leased out to drivers. This ownership structure creates internal competition to pack as many people as possible in a single bus for that directly determines their daily income. There is no regard for max capacity and even when you are suffocating inside, the conductor finds a way to squeeze in another person.</p><p>The bus stopped for me but I couldn&rsquo;t see any room to get in. The conductor implored the people standing to move back. I found solid footing on the second step of the bus entrance and held on for dear life on the hand rail until someone got off and I was able to move further in. Public buses are generally wider and have tons of space in the middle as they are optimized for short journeys. Aside from &ldquo;Sajha Yatayat&rdquo;, most public buses in KTM are actually passenger buses where the seats are organized in rows leaving little space in the middle. Given how dense the city is, a lot of people rely on buses, vans, and large tuk-tuks for their daily commute. So saying that buses are crowded during the week is an extreme understatement.</p><p>Fares are dealt out exclusively in cash. Usually the transaction takes place at the end but the conductor can ask for it if they have some space to move around (nonexistent during rush hours). There is a standard fare of about 20 rupees but it can fluctuate up or down depending on where you got on. Exact change is very important otherwise you&rsquo;ll catch the wrath of your fellow passengers when the bus is held up due to the conductor making change. I saw one guy try to pay his fare with a 1000 rupees and it took so long that the bus took off without giving the guy his complete change.</p><figure class=photo-container><span class="tape tape-tm"></span><img class=photo src=https://storage.googleapis.com/neptro-entries/riding-the-bus/night.jpeg></figure><p>I got off at the &ldquo;Shahid Gate&rdquo; transfer point. Since most people were getting off, I was able to exit scot-free; otherwise you&rsquo;d need to aggressively squeeze your way out through walls of immobile individuals like an urban contortionist. It&rsquo;s honestly worse than getting out of a packed NYC subway.</p><p>&ldquo;Sajha Yatayat&rdquo; looks like actual public bus although still privately owned (it used to be publicly run before it was privatized because the government was supposedly unable to turn a profit). It is very spacious, has column seats, and you get an actual ticket when you pay the fare. It took me around an hour but I managed to get to work via the KTM bus system in one piece.</p></section><h3 class=text-left>- tagus</h3><div class=mt-3xl><hr class=line><div class="color-gray-2 spacing-x-s"><a class=font-2s href=/entries>entries</a>
