The real fun started as soon as I landed in Doha. I had scheduled my next flight to KTM with only an hour transit. A high risk, high reward situation that inevitably failed because the first flight was delayed by 30 minutes. An employee at the gate gave me a new boarding pass and informed me that I was scheduled on the next flight three hours later.</p><p>No sweat, I would just wait at a terminal and try to read a few pages of <em>Norwegian Wood.</em> Finding an empty terminal at eight in the morning was easy enough. The covid protocols included blocking off every other seats at terminals. This coupled with the emptiness made the airport seem much smaller than before and more isolating. I found an empty row and plopped down to get settled in but I was way more tired than I thought––made sense considering I had been running on less than four hours of sleep across the past few days.</p><p>Time slowly crept along as I waited for my gate to be assigned. Turns out I was in the wrong terminal so I made my way across the airport awkwardly lugging my jacket which was too hot to wear and too large to fit inside my suitcase. A few people on my flight had started gathering around my gate. I got some coffee in hopes of keeping conscious and stayed put. I waited out an hour alternating between HxH on my phone and an Al-Jazeera documentary on the ubiquity of Yoga in pop culture that was silently playing in the mounted TVs.</p><p>I decided to get closer and saw a line at the check-in counter. Anxious to get inside and settle in for the last four hour stretch, I got in line. The line was probably 99% Nepali. It started to dawn on my that I was actually going back after seven years. I was hearing at least three different languages across the passengers with body language ranging from extreme fatigue to ex-pat swagger.</p><p>Finally everyone got on the plane. It was smaller than I expected but I was just looking forward to seeing the himalayas on the descent down to the valley. I settled into my seat which was around a lot of people coming straight from Qatar. They were in a way more excitable mood than me and it was a bit suffocating. T-4 hours, no problem. I was surprisingly still awake and was hoping for my adrenaline undercurrent to take me straight to Nepal.</p><p>I waited for the takeoff. 15 minutes passed&mldr; then another 15. They&rsquo;re probably just getting ready. I was already in the plane so we had to go right? The overhead PA comes on and I can barely hear the pilot but I made out the following words: &ldquo;operational problem&rdquo;, &ldquo;please disembark&rdquo;, &ldquo;three hours&rdquo;.</p><p>BIG F</p><p>Before everyone else snapped out of denial, I quickly got up and grabbed my stuff and bolted to the front. As I came back to the terminal I was hoping to never see again, the ground staff were directing people to the food court for a free lunch as compensation. I wonder if I could have traded it in for my sanity instead.</p><p>Three long hours later, I was back yet again at the terminal. With deep suspicion, I inched forward fearing another &ldquo;operational failure.&rdquo; Thankfully, the gate opened and I was quickly back on the plane. I was getting to that point in a long flight where you wish to never get on a plane again and swear off anything resembling airplane food. I forced myself to stay awake to avoid jeopardizing my future sleep. Let&rsquo;s just say it was a very long four hours.</p><p>The last third of the flight was literally a daze. I snapped back to reality once I saw the sea of twinkling bulbs in the valley out the window. I couldn&rsquo;t make anything out in the dark but I saw a couple of breathing neon lights lining buildings. A huge Buddha statue greeted me upon entering the arrivals zone. The red brick walls behind decorative wooden panels made me feel right at home.</p><p>I waited in line to show my covid documents (thank you cvs for a quick PCR turnaround) and finally made my way to customs. A couple of wrong lines later I was out with an official grant of stay for 90 days. Next was security where the staff did not seemed too concerned with my non empty water bottle. This was going a little too smoothly but given that I was pushing midnight, I was not complaining.</p><p>Finally came baggage claim. I swear it looked like a live cattle auction except with an endless array of luggage that all looked the same. Baggage trolleys were lined up with no space in between and people were unable to move up or back out. Unexpectedly I saw what looked like my bag out the corner of my eye and using my most polite Nepali, I finessed my way to the front and asked a kind gentleman to let me get in to grab it. Without a cart, I was stuck lugging the bags one by one––so much for not leaving unattended baggage.</p><p>With everything in place, I found my way to the exit and furtively tried to look at everyone waiting in arrivals checking if I recognized anyone. The masks really made it that much more confusing but I recognized my aunt instantly and knew I had finally made it.</p></section><h3 class=text-left>- tagus</h3><div class=mt-3xl><hr class=line><div class="color-gray-2 spacing-x-s"><a class=font-2s href=/entries>entries</a>
